# Challenge One: Lorem Ipsum

## Introduction:
We're going to start off with something relatively simple: an Ipsum generator. For those of you who don't know, Ipsum is a randomly generated Latin text that is often used in samples of websites or other applications to simulate what text will look like for a client. For more information, visit <https://www.lipsum.com/> - this site also includes precisely what it is this challenge is looking for with its generator.

## Objectives:
1. The primary objective of this challenge is to create a bot that will generate random or pseudo-random text for the user.
2. The generated text need not be Lorem Ipsum based, nor Latin at all. The only criteria is that it must not be in any way offensive, illicit or illegal, and it must be generated in such a way that a pattern is not obviously seen.
3. The amount of text generated should be able to be specified by the user, in a similar way to the website provided for reference. However, the complexity of this system is at your discretion.

## Submission:
1. Create a fork of https://github.com/Mundayne/DBotsChallenge01.
2. Create a folder within the repo named with your name.
3. Work inside that folder.
4. Create a pull request to the original repo when done.
